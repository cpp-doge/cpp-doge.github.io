<p>If it makes my eyes bleed, am I going to be motivated to help?</p>

<h4 id="attention-to-detail-is-important">Attention To Detail Is Important</h4>
<p>Programming is a detail oriented art. If you neglect details
you will make lots of mistakes, your code will be bad,
your programs will have errors, you will cause yourself
(and others) much undue pain debugging problems you could
have easily avoided.</p>
<h4 id="caring-is-important">Caring is important</h4>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t care about something then you won&rsquo;t do a good job.
Your final product will be low quality and bad. Your work will
cause pain for you and for others.</p>
<p>Why should you care?</p>
<ul>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t care about what you eat, can I interest you in this turd sandwich? Maybe a urine cocktail, or a vomit stew?</li>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t care about your privacy, then surely you don&rsquo;t mind if I watch you take a shower?</li>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t care about your personal belongings, then surely I can simply take them for myself. It&rsquo;s not stealing, because you don&rsquo;t care, right?</li>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t care about your code, then surely your code will be bad.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-story">A Story</h3>
<p>The parable of <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/brown-out/">The Brown M&amp;M&rsquo;s</a>
is a story about Van Halen, a popular 1980s rock band.</p>
<p>As part of their contract they requested a bowl of M&amp;M&rsquo;s candy in their
dressing room with all the brown colored ones removed.</p>
<p>This seems like a small detail, and it admittedly is, but small
details can matter a lot.</p>
<p>Bands like Van Halen and Kiss had (still have?) fireworks, explosions
and other pyrotechnics on stage. This is fire. Fire can kill people, it
is no laughing matter.</p>
<p>If the venue organizers neglected to observe one of the details in
the contract, maybe they also neglected to observe some important
safety guideline for working with fire on stage.</p>
<p>Van Halen claims that this in fact the case, that any time they
found brown M&amp;M&rsquo;s, a subsequent stage audit would reveal dangerous
flaws and oversights in the stage preparation.</p>
<h2 id="the-moral-of-the-story">The Moral Of The Story</h2>
<p>One seemingly small oversight is often indicative
of larger, worse and more dangerous problems.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also indicative of carelessness and low quality work.</p>
<h3 id="canary-in-the-coal-mine">Canary In The Coal Mine</h3>
<p>If one or more small easily addressable problems are present
in your code, then I instantly begin to wonder how many other
problems there are with your code.</p>
<p>The answer is: probably a lot.</p>
<p>If it seems apparent that you may have hundreds of other problems
that you could have avoided through attention to detail then
I may be bit apathetic to help.</p>
<h3 id="actually-caring">Actually Caring</h3>
<p>I have spent thousands of hours caring about and perfecting my craft.</p>
<p>If you show me that you probably don&rsquo;t care about
what is not only my hobby, but my career and my life,
then I feel sad and I probably don&rsquo;t want to help you.</p>
<p>When you show me that you do care, at least even a little bit, then
I do want to help you.</p>
