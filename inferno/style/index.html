    <section class="post-content"><h2 id="a-matter-of-style">A Matter Of Style</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-style">What Is Style</h3>
<p>Style consists of the subjective choices you make like
how you name your variables, how you organize your files,
how much whitespace you use and where you put that whitespace.</p>
<h2 id="why-it-matters">Why It Matters</h2>
<p>If it makes my eyes bleed, am I going to be motivated to help?</p>
<p><img src="https://media.tenor.com/I3C9wDN_ZDkAAAAC/my-eyes.gif" alt="My Eyes"></p>
<h4 id="attention-to-detail-is-important">Attention To Detail Is Important</h4>
<p>Programming is a detail oriented art. If you neglect details
you will make lots of mistakes, your code will be bad,
your programs will have errors, you will cause yourself
(and others) much undue pain debugging problems you could
have easily avoided.</p>
<h4 id="caring-is-important">Caring is important</h4>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t care about something then you won&rsquo;t do a good job.
Your final product will be low quality and bad. Your work will
cause pain for you and for others.</p>
<p>Why should you care?</p>
<ul>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t care about what you eat, can I interest you in this turd sandwich? Maybe a urine cocktail, or a vomit stew?</li>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t care about your privacy, then surely you don&rsquo;t mind if I watch you take a shower?</li>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t care about your personal belongings, then surely I can simply take them for myself. It&rsquo;s not stealing, because you don&rsquo;t care, right?</li>
<li><em><strong>If you don&rsquo;t care about your code, then surely your code will be bad.</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-story">A Story</h3>
<p>The parable of <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/brown-out/">The Brown M&amp;M&rsquo;s</a>
is a story about Van Halen, a popular 1980s rock band.</p>
<p>As part of their contract they requested a bowl of M&amp;M&rsquo;s candy in their
dressing room with all the brown colored ones removed.</p>
<p>This seems like a small detail, and it admittedly is, but small
details can matter a lot.</p>
<p>Bands like Van Halen and Kiss had (still have?) fireworks, explosions
and other pyrotechnics on stage. This is fire. Fire can kill people, it
is no laughing matter.</p>
<p>If the venue organizers neglected to observe one of the details in
the contract, maybe they also neglected to observe some important
safety guideline for working with fire on stage.</p>
<p>Van Halen claims that this in fact the case, that any time they
found brown M&amp;M&rsquo;s, a subsequent stage audit would reveal dangerous
flaws and oversights in the stage preparation.</p>
<h2 id="the-moral-of-the-story">The Moral Of The Story</h2>
<p>One seemingly small oversight is often indicative
of larger, worse and more dangerous problems.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also indicative of carelessness and low quality work.</p>
<h3 id="canary-in-the-coal-mine">Canary In The Coal Mine</h3>
<p>If one or more small easily addressable problems are present
in your code, then I instantly begin to wonder how many other
problems there are with your code.</p>
<p>The answer is: probably a lot.</p>
<p>If it seems apparent that you may have hundreds of other problems to
fix before we really get to helping you with the core of
your main problem, then I don&rsquo;t really want to participate,</p>
<p>I also wonder why you don&rsquo;t care to fix these.</p>
<h3 id="actually-caring">Actually Caring</h3>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t care enough to format your code nicely so it is pleasant
to read for yourself (much less other people) then I don&rsquo;t care to
help you.</p>
<p>I have spent thousands of hours caring about and perfecting my craft.
When you show me that you fundamentally probably don&rsquo;t care about
what is effectively not only my hobby, but my career and my life,
then I feel rather insulted and I don&rsquo;t want to help you.</p>
<p>Show me that you care.</p>
<h2 id="what-and-how">What And How</h2>
<h3 id="be-consistent">Be Consistent</h3>
<p>Consistency breeds familiarity. Familiarity breeds quick
recognition. Quick recognition frees your brain to think about
more important things. All of this means you can work
faster and write better more robust code.</p>
<p>There are many subjective decisions to be made with regard to style.</p>
<ul>
<li>Should you use same line curly braces or next line curly braces?</li>
<li>Should you use hungarian notation?</li>
<li>Should you put spaces inside of conditional clauses?</li>
<li>Camel case, snake case or Pascal case?</li>
<li>East const or west const?</li>
<li>East ref or west ref?</li>
<li>East pointer or west pointer?</li>
</ul>
<p>The answer is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what you choose</li>
<li>Just keep it the same for everything</li>
<li>Keep it consistent</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="whitespace">Whitespace</h3>
<p>We put spaces between words in English to help make things
easier to read.</p>
<p>You should do the same for your code.</p>
<p>Whitespace characters are things like spaces, line breaks and tabs.</p>
<p>These are the &ldquo;invisible&rdquo; yet visible characters. They contain no
squiggly lines like the letter <code>g</code> or the letter <code>z</code> but they
still affect how your code looks.</p>
<p>When you press the space bar you insert a space. When you hit
enter you insert a line break, also called a newline.</p>
<p>Where whitespace is allowed, you may use as much of it as you wish.</p>
<p>If you are allowed to put one space, you may instead put 3 or 4, or
put a line break instead.</p>
<h3 id="indentation">Indentation</h3>
<p>We indent code blocks to make it more immediately obvious which
code belongs to which blocks.</p>
<p>You should indent your code appropriately. You should also make
use of whitespace like newlines. For example</p>
