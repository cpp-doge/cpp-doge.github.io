Sometimes also known as a Minimal Complete and Viable Example or MCVE.
How Do I Make One? See: Howto Use Wandbox Video
Use an online compiler website that can compile and run your code like
Wandbox Godbolt For smaller examples you can also use the discord bot to compile and run your code.</description>
