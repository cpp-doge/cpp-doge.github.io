    <section class="post-content"><h2 id="before-you-begin">Before You Begin</h2>
<p>See: <a href="/posts/how-binary-works/">How Binary Works</a></p>
<h2 id="computer-memory">Computer Memory</h2>
<p>Computers store information in memory as binary numbers.</p>
<h3 id="transistors">Transistors</h3>
<p>Transistors are good at turning on and off. This
can easily be used represent a one or a zero.</p>
<p>The information in your computer is managed by a bunch
of transitors. You can think of it like being one
bit per transistor, meaning each transistor can
represent either a zero or a one. It&rsquo;s usually more
complicated, but you can think of it like this.</p>
<p>Transistors can then be combined into larger binary
numbers the same way we combine regular human digits into
larger base ten numbers.</p>
<h3 id="bytes">Bytes</h3>
<p>Your computer hardware organizes your computer memory
into small chunks called bytes. A byte is just the
smallest group of transistors that can be <em>chewed</em>
on at the same time, pun intended.</p>
<p>Your computer memory is layed out in a flat linear
sequence of bytes. You can do stuff with more than
one byte at a time, but not with less than one byte
at a time.</p>
<p>A byte is 8 bits on most normal computers, iPhones
Android Phones, Smart TVs etc, but is sometimes different
in other places. Arduino uses 12 bits per byte.</p>
<p>You can probably assume that bytes are always 8 bits.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-can-we-count">How Much Can We Count</h3>
<p>People use tools like this &ldquo;Tally Counter&rdquo; to count things, maybe like
people passing through a ticket gate to a football game.</p>
<p><img width="600" alt="Tally Counter" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Tally_counter.jpg"></p>
<p>This tally counter only has four digits, so how many things
can we count until we run out of digits?</p>
<p>Well, we can count <code>9999</code> things before the digits reset
back to zero.</p>
<p>Memory in a computer has a similar limitation. We can
count as many things as we have binary digits, and then
the number will reset or &ldquo;roll over&rdquo; to zero.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-memory-can-we-use">How Much Memory Can We Use</h3>
<p>Memory in a computer is limited. Many people have a lot
of RAM in their computers these days, but wouldn&rsquo;t most
of us still want more?</p>
<p>We sometimes place extraordinary demands on computers
with video games, artificial intelligence, websites used
by billions of people, video editing, photo editing,
music production, 3D modeling and more.</p>
<p>How much memory do we need to store a single number?
Why use more memory than we really need to for only
a single number?</p>
<p>The answer is that these things have mostly already
been chosen for you. You generally have the choice
between four bytes per number or eight bytes per
number. This corresponds to 32-bits per number and
64-bits per number. You have likely already heard these
numbers talked about elsewhere.</p>
<p>Notice that, as with the tally counter above, this
means we have a limited number of digits so we
can only count a limited number things.</p>
<h4 id="how-big-are-we-talking">How Big Are We Talking</h4>
<p>How big of a number can I store with 32-bits</p>
<ul>
<li>Up to about four billion or 4,000,000,000</li>
<li>To be precise we can count up to 4,294,967,295</li>
<li>After that the number will roll back over to zero, like the tally counter</li>
</ul>
<p>How big of a number can I store with 64-bits</p>
<ul>
<li>Up to about eighteen quintillion or 18,000,000,000,000,000,000</li>
<li>To be precise we can count up to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615</li>
<li>After that the number will roll back over to zero, like the tally counter</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="those-are-some-weird-numbers">Those Are Some Weird Numbers</h4>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Digits in a computer are binary, so how many things we
can count is different than if those digits were our familiar
human base ten system.</p>
<h4 id="what-should-i-use">What Should I Use</h4>
<p>Ask yourself</p>
<ul>
<li>Do I need more than a few quintillion things in my computer program?</li>
<li>If not then an eight byte 64-bit number is probably fine</li>
</ul>
<p>Then ask yourself</p>
<ul>
<li>Do I need more than a few billion things in my computer program?</li>
<li>If not then a four byte 32-bit number is probably fine</li>
</ul>
<p>A billion things is probably more than enough for most people
on most days.</p>
<h2 id="different-strokes-for-different-folks">Different Strokes For Different Folks</h2>
<h3 id="negative-numbers">Negative Numbers</h3>
<p>So far we have only talked about positive integers, sometimes
called the natural numbers or the counting numbers.</p>
<p>Negative numbers are also a thing and we also need a way
to treat some ones and zeros as a negative number as well
as a positive number.</p>
<p>There is a clever trick for this called Two&rsquo;s Complement.</p>
<p>I cannot do this topic justice, but this video can.</p>
<div style="padding-left:40px;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lKTsv6iVxV4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>You can come back to this later, it&rsquo;s a bit more complicated than
we need to worry about for now, the next sections will help
demonstrate the basic idea that what we store in memory is
different depending on how we look at it.</p>
<h3 id="floating-point-numbers">Floating Point Numbers</h3>
<p>Real numbers are numbers that have a fractional or decimal
part. So far we have only talked about integers. A key
important difference that we now come to is how we use
the computer&rsquo;s memory and what that memory means.</p>
<p>Real numbers can be stored using 32-bits each or 64-bits
each. As with integers, either of the these is likely far more
memory per number than most people will ever need.</p>
<p>There is a <strong>VERY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE</strong> however, which is
the binary digits mean <strong>DIFFERENT THINGS</strong> for a real
number inside a computer than they do for an integer
inside a computer.</p>
<p>Floating point numbers are too much to cover here, but
the short simple answer is that we take a chunk of
memory, let&rsquo;s say four bytes, and then we split that
conceptually so that some of the digits represent
the number and some of those digits represent where
the decimal point is.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s invent a hypothetical 32-bit binary number
for example purposes.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span class="line"><span class="cl">01000000010010001111010111000011
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Let&rsquo;s conceptually view this as four bytes of
data because that&rsquo;s how it lives in the computer.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span class="line"><span class="cl">01000000 01001000 11110101 11000011
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If we treat this number as a floating point number
instead of an integer then we might look at it like this</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span class="line"><span class="cl">     This is the number part
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">                |

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    /                        \           ---|--
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">   /                          \         /      \
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  /                            \       /        \
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"> /                              \     /          \
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">|                                |   |            |

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">   01000000  01001000  11110101         11000011
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Exactly what this looks like may vary from
computer to computer.</p>
<p>When we treat our binary number like this then
this number happens to be 3.14 or approximately
Pi in my computer.</p>
<p>However, if we treat it like a regular integer
then it&rsquo;s actually 1,078,523,331! That&rsquo;s a big
difference between about three and about a billion!</p>
<h4 id="more-floating-point-stuff">More Floating Point Stuff</h4>
<p>This topic is pretty darn complex and challenging.
I only want to demonstrate the general idea that
some binary digits in memory may represent
very different things, a point I will further
belabor in the next section.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re really masochistic you might enjoy the
Wikpedia article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic">Floating Point</a> numbers.</p>
<h3 id="plain-text">Plain Text</h3>
<p>Well, we can store numbers in the computer. That&rsquo;s
good, we need numbers for things like video games
and online shopping.</p>
<p>What about regular normal ish human language?</p>
<p>Well, the computer <em>only stores numbers</em>, binary
numbers. How can we store some text?</p>
<p>The answer is to pretend that each number in the
computer represents a letter of the alphabet.</p>
<p>This is where we get ASCII. ASCII is an official
standard that associates numbers to letters.</p>
<p>Confusingly, the digits we normally use, themselves
are mapped to other numbers in ASCII and those
other numbers are different than the digits themselves!</p>
<p>Take a look a which numbers are mapped
to which letters in the <a href="https://www.asciitable.com/">ASCII Table</a>.</p>
<p>For example, in ASCII, the number <code>65</code> represents
the capital letter <code>A</code>, the first letter of the
alphabet. The number <code>51</code> actually represents
the numeral digit <code>3</code>! What!? Why isn&rsquo;t <code>3</code>
actually <code>3</code>!?</p>
<p><img src="https://media.tenor.com/ZmHeuUmF6xAAAAAC/math-is-math-incredibles.gif" alt="Math"></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just how it is, so you pretty much
just get to live with it for now, sorry.</p>
<h4 id="a-plain-text-example">A Plain Text Example</h4>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say we have five bytes of memory, and
in those bytes we have the binary number.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span class="line"><span class="cl">10010001100101110110011011001101111
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Let&rsquo;s conceptualize this as five separate bytes</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span class="line"><span class="cl">1001000 1100101 1101100 1101100 1101111
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>So what do these bytes mean? Well if we treat them
as ASCII text then each byte is a single number
that represents an ASCII character from the
ASCII Table.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s figure out what these numbers mean.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>1001000</code> in binary = <code>72</code> in base ten</li>
<li><code>1100101</code> in binary = <code>101</code> in base ten</li>
<li><code>1101100</code> in binary = <code>108</code> in base ten</li>
<li><code>1101100</code> in binary = <code>108</code> in base ten a second time</li>
<li><code>1101111</code> in binary = <code>111</code> in base ten</li>
</ul>
<p>If we look up these numbers in the <a href="https://www.asciitable.com/">ASCII Table</a>
we find that</p>
<ul>
<li><code>72</code> = <code>'H'</code></li>
<li><code>101</code> = <code>'e'</code></li>
<li><code>108</code> = <code>'l'</code></li>
<li><code>108</code> = <code>'l'</code> a second time</li>
<li><code>111</code> = <code>'o'</code></li>
</ul>
<p>So these bytes, when treated as ASCII text
mean <code>Hello</code>.</p>
<p>However, if we treat these bytes as an integer
number instead we get the number 19,540,948,591!
I dare say that the word <code>Hello</code> and the number
about ninteen billion are very different things!</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-data-type">What Is A Data Type</h2>
<p>Ok, so let&rsquo;s review</p>
<ul>
<li>A byte is the smallest chunk of memory we can use</li>
<li>We can use four byte numbers or eight byte numbers</li>
<li>We can pretend some bytes are text instead of numbers</li>
<li>How we view the bytes completely changes what the data is!</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where we find a real need to start talking
about the concept of a <em>Data Type</em>.</p>
<h3 id="no-really-what-is-a-data-type">No Really What Is A Data Type</h3>
<p>A <em>Data Type</em>, simply put, describes what is
in some memory. Is it a number, if so what kind of number?
Is it some text? If so, what kind of text, is it ASCII? Is
it Unicode? If so, which kind of Unicode?</p>
<p>For this reason, we have <em>Data Types</em>. A data type
basically just says what is in some memory, and maybe
also says something about how much memory is used.</p>
<h3 id="some-simple-examples">Some Simple Examples</h3>
<p>For example in C++</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>int</code> data type means a 32-bit integer, one that can be negative</li>
<li>The <code>long</code> data type means a 64-bit integer, one that can be negative</li>
<li>The <code>unsigned int</code> data type means a 32-bit integer, one that can ONLY be positive</li>
<li>The <code>unsigned long</code> data type means a 64-bit integer, one that can ONLY be positive</li>
<li>The <code>float</code> data type means a 32-bit decimal number</li>
<li>The <code>double</code> data type means a 64-bit decimal number, or double the size of a float, hence the name</li>
</ul>
<p>This may not always be perfectly true, but let&rsquo;s roll with it for now.</p>
<h3 id="text-data-types">Text Data Types</h3>
<p>In the world of regular human language, like some English
language text, we have the <code>char</code> data type which is a single
byte of memory that represents some alphabet character.</p>
<p>We can store as many chars in a row as we want or need, we are
not limited to four byte or eight byte chunks. We
could store the entire works of Shakespear this way.</p>
<h3 id="your-own-data-types">Your Own Data Types</h3>
<p>C++ lets you create your own custom data types by writing
classes.</p>
<p>We can also use a bunch of the classes that are
already written for us that come from the C++ standard
library.</p>
<p>These classes let us do things like easily deal with
text, do advanced math like with complex numbers, read
and write files, take user input, print stuff to the
screen, check the current date and time and much more!</p>
<p>These classes, are themselves, data types! WOW!</p>
<h3 id="why-write-your-own">Why Write Your Own</h3>
<p>Why would you want to write your own data type? That&rsquo;s
a good question.</p>
<p>Some data you have might consist of a large chunk of memory
like a bunch of integers or real numbers that form
something bigger when considered as a whole. You might
also have some text and numbers that belong together.</p>
<p>Examples might be</p>
<ul>
<li>A vacation photo</li>
<li>A wedding video</li>
<li>A wheel on a self driving car</li>
<li>A 3D video game model</li>
<li>Some music like a song</li>
<li>Some audio like a podcast</li>
<li>A candlestick price on the stock market</li>
<li>A planet in a physics simulation</li>
<li>A molecule in a chemistry simulation</li>
<li>A database connection</li>
<li>A network packet</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-end">The End</h2>
<p>Actually. This is only the beginning.</p>
<p>There is a lot more to learn about programming and
data types, especially making your own.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
