    <section class="post-content"><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>There is too much to cover in this guide. This guide
presents most of the bare bones basics of working
with libraries on your own, by hand, from the command
line.</p>
<p>Expect that you will need to continue learning, researching
and studying as you grow your skills and career as a
programmer.</p>
<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>It is critically important to understand the basics
of creating and using your own libraries so that
you are better and more able to use other people&rsquo;s
libraries with less pain.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-libraries">What Are Libraries</h3>
<p>Libraries are convenient reusable collections of
code. Some libraries do not require compilation
but many do.</p>
<p>Organizing your program into multiple separate
libraries has advantages such as better reusability,
better modularity, less coupling, better unit
testability and probably faster compile times.</p>
<p>If you want to use other people&rsquo;s libraries, it
will help greatly to understand what libraries
are and how to write, build and use them yourself.</p>
<p>Using libraries in your program on Linux for example
is usually quite easy for you and your users by using your
Linux package manager such as <code>apt</code> or <code>yum</code>.</p>
<p>Learning how to use libraries is mandatory if you want to
be successful in general C++ programming, or at
least if you prefer to avoid pain.</p>
<h2 id="link-libraries">Link Libraries</h2>
<p>Regardless of type, your compiler needs
to know how to make a library part of your
program. When referring to any library that
needs to become part of your program during
compilation, we will refer specifically to
&ldquo;Link Libraries&rdquo;, meaning special files
that your compiler needs to know about when
you build your program.</p>
<p>You have already seen the separate linking
phase for simple programs. You can link
multiple object files into a single program.</p>
<p>You can also link libraries into your program
including your own libraries or libraries
written by other people.</p>
<h3 id="static-or-shared">Static Or Shared</h3>
<p>Libraries come in two basic flavors</p>
<ul>
<li>Static libraries</li>
<li>Shared libraries</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="static-libraries">Static Libraries</h3>
<p>Static libraries become part of your final program
and so your program can be more self contained.</p>
<p>Static libraries are often easier and simpler to
work with and involve less pain.</p>
<p>Static libraries also make your program larger and
may not be suitable for every program.</p>
<p>Using the static C++ standard library is possible
but generally not recommended.</p>
<h3 id="shared-libraries">Shared Libraries</h3>
<p>Shared libraries live as separate independent
files, not part of your main program.</p>
<p>Your program must be able to find and load
these shared libraries when you run your program.</p>
<p>Shared libraries have some advantages like allowing
users to upgrade some library used by your program
without recompiling your program.</p>
<p>Shared libraries facilitate features such as
video game mods. Many popular games allow mods
such as Skyrim and Minecraft. Mods often come
in the form of shared libraries.</p>
<p>For example the <a href="http://enbdev.com/">ENB Mod for Skyrim</a>
adds cool graphical effects such as richer shadows
and more intense light rays. ENB is a shared library.</p>
<p>Unlike static libraries, shared libraries
must be installed and available on a user&rsquo;s
computer, otherwise your program will not run.</p>
<p>This may involve more complexity for you when
creating installers, or more complexity for
your users when they install your program.</p>
<p>Like static libraries, shared libraries may not
be suitable for every situation.</p>
<h2 id="about-the-examples">About The Examples</h2>
<p>The further examples in this guide make some
simple assumptions.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s begin by supposing that you have some
code for doing video game math that you want
to reuse in multiple different video games
you are making.</p>
<p>These hypothetical files are variously named</p>
<ul>
<li><code>algebra.cpp</code></li>
<li><code>calculus.cpp</code></li>
<li><code>physics.cpp</code></li>
<li><code>graphics.cpp</code></li>
</ul>
<p>and together they (hypothetically) contain common,
convenient useful math functions that we use often
for video game related purposes.</p>
<p>The goal is to turn these files into a single
library file that we can use in all our video
game projects.</p>
<p>You are expected to be creative here, you probably
have different files with different names and
different functions, but this example demonstrates
the basic idea.</p>
<p>Use your imagination. You can then apply this information
to your project.</p>
<p>You will see how to do this in the next chapters.</p>
<h3 id="building-libraries">Building Libraries</h3>
<p>To build a library, the steps are
similar to the discrete build from earlier
in this guide where you compile and link
separately.</p>
<p>The main difference is that instead of turning
your object files into a runnable program, you
turn your object files in to a library that can
then be used in all the video games you work on.</p>
<p>This is convenient for many reasons. For example
if you add a new function to your library, you
can simply recompile all your video games and
they will all have the new function available.</p>
<p>You can also test your library in isolation,
apart from your actual video game projects to
be sure that the library works correctly. This
gives you confidence that all your games will
work correctly, or at least the math parts will
work correctly.</p>
