      <description>Why It Matters If it makes my eyes bleed, am I going to be motivated to help?
Attention To Detail Is Important Programming is a detail oriented art. If you neglect details you will make lots of mistakes, your code will be bad, your programs will have errors, you will cause yourself (and others) much undue pain debugging problems you could have easily avoided.
Caring is important If you don&amp;rsquo;t care about something then you won&amp;rsquo;t do a good job.</description>

      <description>Basics TLDR Shorten your code and post it to Wandbox.org

What Is It? A Minimal Reproducible Example is exactly enough code to demonstrate your problem, but no more and no less.
Sometimes also known as a Minimal Complete and Viable Example or MCVE.
How Do I Make One? See: Howto Use Wandbox Video
Use an online compiler website that can compile and run your code like</description>

      <description>In 60 Seconds Use Visual Studio for Windows. It&amp;rsquo;s FREE! It does everything you want.
Download: Visual Studio
Visual Studio is not VSCode, they are different products. Visual Studio comes with a compiler, no need for MinGW. See also I Am Not Using Windows

Visual Studio doesn&amp;rsquo;t configure itself, you still have to do that, but doing so should be much easier for beginners as compared to VSCode.</description>

      <description>Where Do I Start Begin by reading your textbook.
But I Don&amp;rsquo;t Have A Textbook Use the one from your syllabus.
But I Don&amp;rsquo;t Have A Syllabus You probably do. Ask your TAs or your professor for book recommendations.
Anyway, you could try a free one like this
Free CompSci Curriculum But I Don&amp;rsquo;t Have A Syllabus Textbook Then get yourself a book, there are free books available.
Paid books are still generally better.</description>

      <description>What Is The Point? I&amp;rsquo;m not here to change your mind if you&amp;rsquo;re a C programmer and you like C and you wish to continue using C.
To the end that C++ programmers may wish to advocate C++ to their C programmer friends, this is a mandatory video to watch.
If you want more perspective on how some C++ programmers feel about C, then this video may be illuminating.
If you, for whatever reason, have an interest in C++ or you want more explanations as to the differences between C and C++, why I like C++, and what makes C++ good, then read on.</description>
