<aside class="post-note info"><p><img src="/s/img/tango/info.png"></p><p>
<p>If you already have code, then just create a new project with
new files anyway. Copy paste your old code into the new files
in the new project.</p>

<p>Using Visual Studio should be <em>very easy</em> but still requires learning.</p>

<h2 id="motivations">Motivations</h2>
<p>In the beginning, C++ YouTube tutorials for newbies commonly recommend using
VSCode, often in conjunction with MinGW for Windows.</p>
<p>This has made a lot of beginners very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move.</p>
<div style="padding-left:40px;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/im9N8bin7Pc?start=2" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>It is extremely common that beginners experience frustration
because using these generally requires extensive experience
and skill. Most beginners do not have this yet.</p>
<p>Using an IDE like Visual Studio means you can avoid the
need to study a bunch of what is, for a beginner, probably
irrelevant information, and instead focus on learning C++.</p>
<p>VSCode is not a build system
so there often arises confusion around this fact and needing
to configure both the build and the syntax checking for
the editor. Many other similar issues also arise for
most beginners when trying to use VSCode.</p>
<p>Visual Studio is an all in one programming tool with a GUI.
You can configure your project by simply right clicking and
browsing through dialog boxes and menus etc. No need to memorize
command line compile flags or other details before you can get to
work learning C++ and writing programs. Visual Studio is
both a code editor and a build system (and much much more), when
you have configured your project once, you are basically done
and you can get to programming.</p>
<p>VSCode is good, but I don&rsquo;t recommend it for beginners or
even up to intermediate level.</p>

<aside class="post-note info"><p><img src="/s/img/tango/info.png"></p><p>
<p>If you are highly motivated to learn the skills you need to make
effective use of a programmer&rsquo;s plain text editor (such as VSCode)
and how to configure a compiler, then you can try my guides on
these topics.</p>
<p><a href="/guides/command-line-primer/">Command Line Primer</a></p>
<p><a href="/guides/building-software/">Building C++ Programs</a></p>
<p>However, I recommend that most people just use an IDE, your life
will be simpler and less painful. Either way, still don&rsquo;t use MinGW.</p>
</p></aside>
<h2 id="what-to-use">What To Use</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;re still here? Ok.</p>
<p>Use <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/">Visual Studio</a>. At
least use an IDE of <a href="#something-else">some kind</a>.</p>
<h3 id="why-an-ide">Why An IDE</h3>
<p>An Integrated Development Environment or IDE is a programmer&rsquo;s tool
that usually comes with most if not all the features you need to
get up and running quickly writing your own programs.</p>
<ul>
<li>You don&rsquo;t really need to know what you&rsquo;re doing yet</li>
<li>It is nearly zero effort and generally pain free</li>
<li>An IDE usually has tons of features including but not limited to
<ul>
<li>Compiler</li>
<li>Build System</li>
<li>Debugger</li>
<li>Terminal</li>
<li>Error Checking</li>
<li>Auto Code Completion</li>
<li>Code Tooltips</li>
<li>Jump To Definition</li>
<li>Jump To Include File</li>
<li>Search In All Files</li>
<li>Package Manager</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Visual Studio at least has all of this, other IDEs may vary</li>
<li>You need to know what you&rsquo;re doing already to use VSCode effectively</li>
<li>VSCode will almost certainly be painful for beginners</li>
</ul>
<p>Using an IDE is arguably still somewhat complex, but you can do
most of what you need through graphical menus, buttons, dialog
boxes etc so you don&rsquo;t need to memorize low level details like
compiler specific command line flags etc.</p>
<h3 id="why-visual-studio">Why Visual Studio</h3>
<p>Visual Studio is an IDE.</p>
<p>Visual Studio is widely considered very good, maybe even the best IDE
of all IDEs on any OS.</p>
<p>Visual Studio is the easiest, simplest and fastest way to get into C++
programming on Windows.</p>
<p>Visual Studio is basically point, click and run. No fuss. It does
a ton of things for you so you can focus on writing and learning C++.</p>
<p>Visual Studio comes with a compiler and a build system, you don&rsquo;t
need to install other tools like MinGW or GNU Make.</p>
<p>Configuring Visual Studio requires some effort but doing so is
mostly trivial to configuring other tools like VSCode.</p>
<p>There is less confusion and less work to do because Visual Studio
already comes with a compiler and a build system.</p>
<p>CMake can generate Visual Studio projects.</p>
<p>Download: <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/">Visual Studio</a></p>
<aside class="post-note info"><p><img src="/s/img/tango/info.png"></p><p>
<p>If you are not on Windows you will need
to use <a href="#something-else">Something Else</a> as a C++ IDE
because Visual Studio for C++ is not available on Mac or Linux.</p>
</p></aside>
<h3 id="why-not-other-ides">Why Not Other IDEs</h3>
<p>Code::Blocks and DevC++ are extremely out of date and not very good.
There are many other better options to choose from.</p>
<p>These products also rely on MinGW on Windows. See <a href="#why-not-mingw">Why Not MinGW</a>.</p>
<aside class="post-note info"><p><img src="/s/img/tango/info.png"></p><p>
<p>No one will stop you from using these, but you will probably
be mostly on your own in learning how to use them, largely
because most people proficient in C++ do not use them because
they are extremely outdated and generally kind of bad, so
there probably won&rsquo;t be many qualified people who both know and
are also willing to help with these products.</p>

<p><em>Visual Studio</em> is <strong>NOT THE SAME</strong> as <em>VSCode</em> despite both of them
having similar names.</p>
<p>The Microsoft web pages for downloading these products also seem
to want people to believe these products are the same, but they are not.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-visual-studio">What Is Visual Studio</h3>
<p>Visual Studio has everything you need to get up and running quickly
writing C++ programs with very little effort.</p>
<p><a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/">Visual Studio</a>
is a <strong>FREE</strong> fully featured Integrated Development Environment or IDE.</p>
<p>An IDE provides all the features you need to get up an running quickly
writing programs. It includes a compiler, a build system, a debugger,
sanitizers, error checking, code completion and more.</p>
<p>You can use Visual Studio for C++, Python, JavaScript, C#.NET and more.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-vscode">What Is VSCode</h3>
<p><em>Visual Studio Code</em> (aka <em>VSCode</em>) is a programmer&rsquo;s plain text editor
useful for a wide variety of programming languages including
JavaScript, Python C++ and almost any other language you can imagine.</p>
<p>VSCode is like a &ldquo;Build Your Own IDE&rdquo; kit. It will not likely work
well out of the box without some configuration, though some plugins
are better than others.</p>
<p>VSCode is quite good, however, using VSCode requires some skill
and experience, or at least a willingness to put in some extra
time and study.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-gcc">What Is GCC</h3>
<p>GCC is <em>The GNU Compiler Collection</em>, a compiler that originated
from GNU/Linux.</p>
<p>GCC was originally (and still mostly is) intended for Linux.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-mingw">What Is MinGW</h3>
<p>MinGW is a just a special version of GCC that lets you write Windows programs.</p>
<p>MinGW means <em>Minimalist GNU For Windows</em>.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-mingw">Why Not MinGW</h2>
<p><img src="/s/img/cameronsworld.net/gold-running-man1.gif" alt="WOW"></p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know what MinGW is and why you want it (other than a tutorial
said so) then you should not use MinGW.</p>
<aside class="post-note info"><p><img src="/s/img/tango/info.png"></p><p>
<p>If you just want GCC for some reason then use GCC from the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install">Windows Subsystem For Linux</a> aka WSL.</p>
<p>See the documentation for <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install">Installing WSL</a>.</p>
</p></aside>
<aside class="post-note warn"><p><img src="/s/img/tango/warn.png"></p><p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t recommend WSL either, for the same reasons. Like VSCode,
using WSL requires background knowledge and skill that most beginners
don&rsquo;t have and don&rsquo;t need.</p>
</p></aside>
<h3 id="reaons-not-to-use-mingw">Reaons Not To Use MinGW</h3>
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio is also free and much better and easier for beginners</li>
<li>MinGW has a history of being incomplete or even bad</li>
<li>For example: MinGW was lacking a random device for a very long time</li>
<li>MinGW will probably always have less than 100% parity with native Windows</li>
<li>MinGW systems typically use Bash which may cause confusion and pain when dealing with Linux vs Windows differences like file paths and more</li>
<li>MinGW receives updates, but why use MinGW when it&rsquo;s incomplete, sometimes bad, and VS is better and also free?</li>
<li>MinGW LLVM is not an appropriate solution either, especially when you could just use native <a href="#clang-for-windows">Clang For Windows</a> instead</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-do-people-use-mingw">Why Do People Use MinGW</h3>
<p>Often because of bad YouTube tutorials.</p>
<p>Maybe also sometimes because of the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html">GPL</a>.</p>
<p>You probably don&rsquo;t need to worry about the GPL.</p>
<h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h2>
<h3 id="clang-for-windows">Clang For Windows</h3>
<p>If you really have a desire to use something else then use
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases">Clang For Windows</a>.</p>
<p>You can install and use Clang <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/clang-support-msbuild">directly from Visual Studio</a>.</p>
<p>Or download the standalone <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases">Clang For Windows Installer</a>.
The file you want is named something like <code>LLVM-15.0.4-win64.exe</code>.</p>
<h3 id="ides-are-slow-i-need-something-fast">IDEs Are Slow I Need Something Fast</h3>
<p>Ok, use a programmer&rsquo;s plain text editor and a build system like CMake.</p>
<aside class="post-note warn"><p><img src="/s/img/tango/warn.png"></p><p>
<p>If you are a beginner, you will have a lot of study ahead of you.</p>
<p>You can do this, but it will take a long time and it will not be easy.</p>
<p>See my guides on these topics.</p>
<p><a href="/guides/command-line-primer/">Command Line Primer</a></p>
<p><a href="/guides/building-software/">Building C++ Programs</a></p>
</p></aside>
<p>Some other plain text editor style programs you might want to try</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.geany.org/">Geany</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a></li>
<li><a href="https://brackets.io/">Brackets</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are billions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_text_editors">other text editors</a>
to choose from.</p>
<p>You will also need a build system of some kind.</p>
<p>I recommend</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/">CMake</a></li>
</ul>
<p>but you could also try any of</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mesonbuild.com/">Meson</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ninja-build.org/">Ninja</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU Make</a></li>
<li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/nmake-reference">NMake</a></li>
<li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild">MSBuild</a></li>
</ul>
<aside class="post-note info"><p><img src="/s/img/tango/info.png"></p><p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t strictly need a build system, you could
just do it by hand or write some shell scripts,
however this is tedious and cumbersome.</p>
<p>This would be a good exercise but a proper build system
has many advantages.</p>
</p></aside>
<h3 id="i-must-use-vscode-and-mingw">I Must Use VSCode And MinGW</h3>
