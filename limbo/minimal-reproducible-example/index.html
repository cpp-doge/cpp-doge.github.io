    <section class="post-content"><h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>
<h3 id="tldr">TLDR</h3>
<p>Shorten your code and post it to <a href="/posts/using-wandbox/">Wandbox.org</a></p>
<p>See also: <a href="/posts/using-wandbox/">Howto Use Wandbox Video</a></p>
<h3 id="what-is-it">What Is It?</h3>
<p>A <em>Minimal Reproducible Example</em> is exactly enough code to demonstrate
your problem, but no more and no less.</p>
<p>Sometimes also known as a <em>Minimal Complete and Viable Example</em>
or <em>MCVE</em>.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-i-make-one">How Do I Make One?</h3>
<p>See: <a href="/posts/using-wandbox/">Howto Use Wandbox Video</a></p>
<p>Use an online compiler website that can compile
and run your code like</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wandbox.org/">Wandbox</a></li>
<li><a href="https://godbolt.org/">Godbolt</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For smaller examples you can also use the
discord bot to compile and run your code.</p>
<p>I advise using an online paste site for your examples.</p>
<aside class="post-note warn"><p><img src="/s/img/tango/warn.png"></p><p>
<p>There is no syntax highlighting on Discord mobile and long
lines are very difficult to read on mobile. Online compiler websites
have syntax highlighting. Websites also usually allow
pinch zooming for mobile users.</p>
</p></aside>
<h2 id="what-do-i-show">What Do I Show?</h2>
<h3 id="it-needs-to-be-minimal">It Needs To Be Minimal</h3>
<p>If you have too much code then start over from scratch.</p>
<p>Copy paste some of your old code if you like.</p>
<p>Strive to make your example fewer than about 50-100 lines.</p>
<p>See Also: <a href="#but-i-cant-split-it-up">But I Can&rsquo;t Split It Up!</a></p>
<h3 id="it-needs-to-be-complete">It Needs To Be Complete</h3>
<p>We need all the details.</p>
<p>Maybe you made a typo we can&rsquo;t see?</p>
<p>See also: <a href="#why-do-i-need-to-show-code">Why Do I Need To Show Code</a></p>
<h3 id="describe-the-problem">Describe The Problem</h3>
<p>This is part of being complete.</p>
<p>Explain in regular English language what the problem is.</p>
<p>Posting code is good, but it&rsquo;s only one of the first steps.</p>
<p>If you have a problem description, like from a leetcode
challenge or a homework assignment, then post the
full problem description.</p>
<p>Show the input and expected output. Explain how what
you get is different from what you want.</p>
<h4 id="it-doesnt-work">It Doesn&rsquo;t Work</h4>
<p>Then post the full error message.</p>
<p>Simply saying &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t work&rdquo; is generally insufficient.</p>
<h4 id="there-is-no-error-message">There Is No Error Message</h4>
<p>Then show the input and expected output. Explain how what
you get is different from what you want.</p>
<p>I somewhat doubt there is no error, but either way do your
best to describe how it is failing.</p>
<aside class="post-note warn"><p><img src="/s/img/tango/warn.png"></p><p>
<p>Saying something like &ldquo;expected output is a full working
video game&rdquo; is not adequate and arguably a bit disingenuous.
It is overly general, it is not specific, it does not help us help you.
Of course everyone wants their code to create a working program, it would
be extremely rare that a programmer wants their code to NOT result in
a working program.</p>
</p></aside>
<p>Saying something like &ldquo;When I run it, it pauses and then
immediately exits with no output&rdquo;, while vague, is still
better and more descriptive than saying &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t work&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="it-needs-to-be-both-minimal-and-complete">It Needs To Be BOTH Minimal AND Complete</h3>
<p>We need to understand the full problem, but
most of us don&rsquo;t want to analyze thousands of lines.</p>
<p>Creating a good minimal example is an art and a delicate balancing act.
It&rsquo;s also a valuable skill to have.</p>
<p>Not too much, not too little.</p>
<h3 id="it-should-compile-and-run">It Should Compile And Run</h3>
<p>The example you provide should compile and run.</p>
<p>Your example should include all your headers and
your <code>main()</code> function.</p>
<h3 id="it-should-be-nicely-formatted">It Should Be Nicely Formatted</h3>
<p>You can easily format your code automatically on Discord.</p>
<p>You can also use automatic formatting tools like
<a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html">Clang Format</a>
and <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/">Clang Tidy</a>.</p>
<p>I advise using an online paste site for your examples.</p>

<h3 id="why-should-i-do-this">Why Should I Do This?</h3>
<p>In the best case:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will often discover and fix your own problems by doing this</li>
</ul>
<p>In the worst case, if you still haven&rsquo;t fixed it:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are better and more quickly able to help</li>
<li>You are more likely to get more and better help</li>
<li>You are being kind to your fellow community members</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="really-tho-why">Really Tho Why?</h2>
<p>Ok, you&rsquo;re still not convinced&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="why-do-i-need-to-show-code">Why Do I Need To Show Code?</h3>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t really need to explain why we need to see code, but here goes.</p>
<p>Showing code is basically the bare minimum entry point for getting
help on a programming help server.</p>
<p>For starters, doing so <a href="#bad-1">probably</a> demonstrates that you are not lazy and you are not asking for
someone to just hand you a solution, asking for which would be academic dishonesty.
Most people are loathe to help the lazy and or the academically dishonest,
not to mention that academic dishonesty is against the rules.</p>
<p>Code is precise and generally unambiguous. Without seeing at least some
code we are left only to guess what your code might look like, what
the problem might be, and what the best solution might be.</p>
<p>By showing code, your situation is much more immediately and abundantly clear.
We can eliminate all kinds of potential ambiguities, miscommunications and
infinite other blocking issues that could be inherent in your current
endeavor and prevent you from getting help.</p>
<p>Showing code doesn&rsquo;t necessarily illuminate your situation perfectly,
but it&rsquo;s generally the bare minimum place you need to start.</p>
<p>For example you could fail to show enough code, or you could make
the mistake of showing too much, or your code could be just bad,
poorly formatted, with bad variable names and difficult to understand.
Plenty of other problems can still exist even when you show code, but
showing code is still thousands of times better than not showing code.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t advise how to fix or improve code we can&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>See also: <a href="#it-needs-to-be-complete">It Needs To Be Complete</a></p>
<h3 id="defining-the-problem">Defining The Problem</h3>
<p>If you need to show more than 100 lines then you have not
isolated and defined the problem very well.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t isolate and define the problem, then you don&rsquo;t understand
the problem; this is bad. It&rsquo;s not reasonable to ask for help with
something we don&rsquo;t understand, much less something you don&rsquo;t understand.
In a case like this you may have <a href="https://pm.stackexchange.com/questions/33711/what-techniques-can-identify-missing-requirements">Hidden Requirements</a>
that are not obvious, maybe that you weren&rsquo;t even aware of.</p>
<h3 id="why-does-it-need-to-be-minimal">Why Does It Need To Be Minimal?</h3>
<p>Even a few lines of code is unintelligable when using Discord
mobile. RIP anyone considering helping you on mobile when your
code is even 50 lines long.</p>
<p>There is some wiggle room, 100 lines is a grey area. It is not a crime
to post a 101 line example. Some people are willing to help with
large examples. However, at some point too much is too much.</p>
<p>The more code you have, the more work you&rsquo;ll need to do to
ensure your example is relatively easy to work with. At least
if you want a decent chance at getting good help.</p>
<h3 id="why-does-it-need-to-be-complete">Why Does It Need To Be Complete?</h3>
<p>What is wrong with the following code?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">qux</span> <span class="n">q</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  <span class="n">bar</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">q</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Who knows? We don&rsquo;t know what <code>qux</code> is and we don&rsquo;t
know what <code>bar</code> is.</p>
<p>I believe that you may believe that you have provided all the necessary
information, but maybe you have not?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an easy mistake to make because you know your code but we do not.</p>
<h3 id="why-should-it-compile-and-run">Why Should It Compile And Run?</h3>
<p>This way we can easily and quickly run it, see what&rsquo;s wrong, make changes and
give it back to you showing how to fix it, and you can
see that it compiles and runs and that it is fixed.</p>
<p>If it doesn&rsquo;t compile then we want the <strong>FULL ERROR MESSAGE</strong> and a complete
<strong>BUT MINIMAL</strong> example that demonstrates the error, and it should
be complete enough to compile and run when the error is fixed.</p>
<h3 id="why-both-minimal-and-complete">Why BOTH Minimal AND Complete?</h3>
<p>We need enough info to help, but we also probably don&rsquo;t want
to read hundreds or thousands of lines. We do this for free.</p>
<p>If adding enough code for us to understand the problem means
adding too much code then you probably have not done a very
good job of isolating and describing the actual problem.</p>
<p>If the problem is not well isolated and well defined then it
will be difficult to provide good help, or maybe any help at all.</p>
<p>Start over from scratch and try again until you have something
small enough to be reasonable for a normal human but that still
shows the full problem.</p>
<p>You may not always have the luxury of readily available free
support. Being able to investigate and solve your own problems
in a pragmatic, evidence based way is then the only option and
is therefor a critical skill to have.</p>
<h3 id="why-should-it-be-nicely-formatted">Why Should It Be Nicely Formatted?</h3>
<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s easy to do. You can use automatic
formatting tools like <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html">Clang Format</a>
so there is no good reason not to do this.</p>
<p>Second. If it makes my eyes bleed, am I going to be motivated to help?</p>
<p><img src="https://media.tenor.com/I3C9wDN_ZDkAAAAC/my-eyes.gif" alt="My Eyes"></p>
<h3 id="for-every-question">For Every Question?</h3>
<p>Yes, most programming questions probably do warrant a
minimal complete and viable example.</p>
<p>You should assume you need to post code.</p>
<h3 id="really-tho-every-question">Really Tho Every Question?</h3>
<p>Not every question requires an example.</p>
<p>Like: &ldquo;How many bytes are there in an <code>int</code>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This can be easily answered and does not depend on your other code.</p>
<aside class="post-note ok"><p><img src="/s/img/tango/ok.png"></p><p>
<p>Even if a minimal example is less warranted, it will
always still be beneficial and productive and will
more effectively communicate your question.</p>
<p>And you will always still get better help.</p>

<ul>
<li>This is not a specific question, nor really a question at all</li>
<li>We are not going to write it for you</li>
<li>Only two of the claimed six files are shown</li>
<li>It would seem you are implicitly asking someone to do it for you</li>
</ul>
<p>This is better than nothing, but it&rsquo;s still less than
the bare minimum. Posting any code at all is only the first
step. The code you post still needs to resemble a minimal
viable example as described in this document.</p>
<p>The code in this example shows no implementation, so it&rsquo;s near
impossible to ask a specific question in the first place.</p>
<p>Please post more relevant code and ask a specific question. Even if
you ask a specific question you need to show that you have at least
tried to write some of these functions yourself.</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="but-mine-isnt-a-linked-list">But Mine Isn&rsquo;t A Linked List</h4>
<p>Being a linked list is not the point, the point is that you need to post
enough code and ask a specific question, or at least any question at all.</p>
<h3 id="good-1">Good</h3>
<p>What would be good is to show all six files mentioned in the
description.</p>
<p>What would be good is to ask any question at all, and better to
ask a more specific question.</p>
<p>What would be good is to show that you have at least tried it
yourself first.</p>
<p>The main point is that we won&rsquo;t do it for you. This is an illustrative
example. There are many reasons I won&rsquo;t show a complete linked list
implementation for you here.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-have-to-do-all-this">Why Do I Have To Do All This?</h3>
<p>Strictly speaking, you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>However&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>You will get more and better help when your examples are good</li>
<li>People respect hard work, dedication and study</li>
<li>People are more likely to help you when you show that you have put in effort</li>
<li>If you show me that you care about programming, then I care to help you</li>
<li>People are providing help to you for free, usually in their spare time</li>
<li>Many of us have stressful full time programming jobs already</li>
<li>We probably don&rsquo;t want to analyze hundreds or thousands of lines of code</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="but-i-cant-split-it-up">But I Can&rsquo;t Split It Up!</h3>
<p>Yes you can.</p>
<h4 id="but-thats-more-work-for-me">But That&rsquo;s More Work For Me!</h4>
<p>Yes, it is.</p>
<h3 id="but-i-really-cant-split-it-up">But I Really Can&rsquo;t Split It Up!</h3>
<p>Yes, you probably can. This is probably just for lack of creativity
on your part. Maybe also for lack of trying?</p>
<p>I claim literally any and every problem is in fact reducible to
say about a hundred lines of code or so. Otherwise you haven&rsquo;t
well isolated and defined the actual problem.</p>
<p>See also <a href="#defining-the-problem">Defining The Problem</a></p>
<p>Isolating and defining the problem well is important for
getting good help, much less any help at all. If we can&rsquo;t understand
the problem (or if it takes too much effort to do so), we will
be unable (or unwilling) to well advise on what the solution should
look like.</p>
<p>Show what you are trying to achieve in isolation. Surely most of
your code is not required to be shown to fully demonstrate the key issue
at hand. Surely we also need enough code to understand the problem,
hence needing to be at the same time minimal yet also complete.</p>
<h3 id="but-i-really-really-cant-split-it-up">But I Really REALLY Can&rsquo;t Split It Up!</h3>
<p>Yes you can. Get creative.</p>
<h4 id="but-thats-more-work-for-me-1">But That&rsquo;s More Work For Me!</h4>
<p>Yes, it is.</p>
<h4 id="thats-way-too-much-work-for-me">That&rsquo;s WAY Too Much Work For Me!</h4>
<p>Then that&rsquo;s probably unreasonable to ask of someone else too, no?</p>
<h3 id="large-or-advanced-projects">Large Or Advanced Projects</h3>
<p>The nature of online help forums is that they have limits. Online
help forums are not fully suitable to help with large or advanced
projects.</p>
<p>They are here to provide general guidance, facilitate intuition,
help you with common problems, soften sharp corners, illuminate best
practices, and provide further resources to supplement your study.</p>

<h3 id="wandbox-doesnt-have">Wandbox Doesn&rsquo;t Have</h3>
<p>SFML, SDL2, GLFW, etc</p>
<p>Sadly this is true. However&hellip;</p>
<p>At some point when you get past beginner phase, you need
to learn to solve your own problems.</p>
<p>See Also: <a href="#your-job">Your Job</a></p>
<p>If you still need help you then do your best to make a minimal
reproducible example anyway, following the instructions
in this guide.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ok if it doesn&rsquo;t compile and run in a case like this
but we still need enough information, and not too much
information.</p>

<h3 id="your-job">Your Job</h3>
<p>At some point in your programming career you need to learn to solve your
own problems. At some point, when you get a lot of code and or code
that is well beyond beginner level (like a 2D/3D game), then dealing with
it becomes your job, and we probably don&rsquo;t want to deal with what likely
has been a full time job worth of effort on your part.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry that this is the case, but this is the case. At some point,
to deal with this much code, you usually need to pay someone. This is
part of why we get paid at our own jobs in the first place.</p>
<p>If no one is helping then consider doing your best to create a minimal
complete and viable example anyway.</p>
<h3 id="a-last-resort">A Last Resort</h3>
<p>As a last resort you could try just putting all your code in a GitHub repo
and giving us the link. Will someone want to read that much code? Probably
not, which is why you should still probably make an MCVE, but maybe someone
will, idk.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
